# Uncommon Java Bug: Premature Loop Termination
This repository showcases a subtle bug in Java related to premature loop termination using a `break` statement.  The code calculates the sum of an array's elements and includes a condition to stop the loop if the sum exceeds 10.  This seemingly simple scenario can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully, especially in more complex loops.
